# dojo-funk-me

First guided dojo to practice some functional programing techniques

## Jargon | Rules of FP (more to come)

Write declaratively, not imperatively
Pure functions
    Side-effect free
Immutable Values
Deterministic Functions
    Referential transparency: The function always gives the same return value for the same arguments
Higher-order functions
    A function which takes a function as an argument and/or returns a function.
Closure
    A closure is a scope which retains variables available to a function when it's created. 
Point-Free Style
    Writing functions where the definition does not explicitly identify the arguments used. This style usually requires currying or other Higher-Order functions. A.K.A Tacit programming.
Function composition
Recursion
